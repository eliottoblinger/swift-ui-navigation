# üåê Navigation - SwiftUI Project

Welcome to the Navigation SwiftUI App! This project demonstrates how to build a SwiftUI app with two views. The first view contains a button labeled "Passer √† l'√©cran suivant" (Go to the next screen). When the button is clicked, it transitions to the next view.

## Project Description

The Navigation SwiftUI App exemplifies the fundamental navigation capabilities of SwiftUI. Upon launching the app, you'll see the initial view with a button labeled "Passer √† l'√©cran suivant." When this button is tapped, the app smoothly transitions to the next view, providing a seamless user experience.
  
## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on the following concepts:

1. **SwiftUI Navigation:** I implemented a basic SwiftUI navigation to move from one view to another.

2. **Button Action Handling:** I added functionality to the button, enabling it to navigate to the next screen upon clicking.
